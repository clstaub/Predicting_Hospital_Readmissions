# Predicting_Hospital_Readmissions
### Claudio Staub


## Introduction
With estimated costs in the order of tens of billions per annum, hospital readmissions impose a significant financial burden on health care institutions across the nation. Up until more recent times, there was not a lot of incentive for Hospitals to reduce these readmissions. When Center for Medicares and Medicaid Services began public reporting hospital readmission rates, the ethical and professional incentive was there, but hospitals that aimed to reduce readmissions were losing revenue unless they could fill their beds. Enter the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) circa 2013 which provided financial incentive for Hospitals to reduce readmissions. 

This has still proven to be a difficult task but hospitals are employing a number of strategies to reduce the preventable readmissions. Progress has been made since the implementation of the HRRP but estimates of readmissions that could have been prevented are still as high as 70%. It is therefore in their best interest to find ways to further reduce this undesirable outcome. 


## Strategy

- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Hypothesis Testing
