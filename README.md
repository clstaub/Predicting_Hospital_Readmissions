# Predicting_Hospital_Readmissions
#### Claudio Staub

## Introduction

With estimated costs in the order of tens of billions per annum, hospital readmissions impose a significant financial burden on health care institutions across the nation. The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) was a program established to reduce the reimbursements for hospitals that fail to meet a defined metric. 

It is therefore an interesting topic to further analyze to see if we can find predictors that would allow for preventative measures to be taken among the right patient population.
